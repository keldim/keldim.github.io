I think Bloc provides a well structured curriculum. It provides learning checkpoints that introduce concepts in manageable sizes and in an order that is least confusing. Even though I had no background in programming, it wasnâ€™t too difficult for me to ease into the field. 

Getting help while learning in Bloc was great. My mentor was always available for chat and willing to answer any questions that I had. The administration staff was always within reach whenever I had questions about the curriculum.

Even though Bloc provided me with great support, it was still difficult to learn programming. There were confusing concepts that I had to look for additional resources other than Bloc to understand them. There were technological terms that I had to look up for in Google. I do not think Bloc had anything to do with this; I think the subject itself requires some degree of self-learning.

Overall, I am satisfied with my experience with Bloc
