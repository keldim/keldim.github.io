As a Frontend developer, I want to understand and be fluent with the commonly used Frontend languages. I want to be fluent with Html/Css, Javascript, jQuery, Angularâ€¦ so that I know which languages to use for each project. For each language, I want to know specific lines of code that will solve the commonly found problems so that I could develop websites quickly and save time on debugging.

I want to be constantly learning new languages that are released. I want to be familiar with them so that I could implement them right away in projects. As a result, I want to be up to date with the recent trends in frontend developing.

I want to be able to cooperate with clients and web designers. I want to listen to their needs and find ways to best satisfy their needs. I want to be familiar with the popular designs on building websites and learn how to build them.
