I think the biggest challenge I faced when learning to develop was figuring out what to do when I got stuck.

Whenever I wrote the code and did not see the result that I expected, I had to figure out what I did wrong when writing the code.

If I quickly figured out where I made a mistake, it was great. If I had no idea what I did wrong, I started dabbling around the areas that I suspected to have made a mistake. I would change the code for each area, see how the outcome changes, and locate the problem. If I still could not find anything, I asked my mentor for help. 

After I found the problem, I would look for answers. First, I went back and review the contents provided by the Bloc curriculum and reviewed my notes for them. If I did not find the solution there, I would google my situation to find answers on blogs, articles, Stack Overflow, Mozilla Developer Network, and etc. If I still did not find anything, then I would ask for help to my mentor.

I would then apply the found solution to my situation. If the solution did not solve my problem, I would go back to the solution finding process. If the solution did work, I will then try to understand the mechanism of the solution. I would pay attention on how the lines of code worked so that I could reapply the solution when the same problem arise or problems related to it arise. If I have trouble understanding how the solution works, I will ask my mentor for assistance.

During the whole process, if I got too frustrated, I would take a rest and come back later to try again.
